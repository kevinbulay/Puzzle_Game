# Puzzle_Game
This game is a puzzle game where the player has to solve all the puzzles to unlock every continent on the globe.
At every puzzle there are different blocks and shapes lying around and the finished pattern appears one second. There is a 1 minute timer at each "level"
and the patterns get more and more complex. When you don't get the pattern right in time you have to start over again.
